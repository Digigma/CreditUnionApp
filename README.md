# CreditUnionApp
An app that is similar to a banking system.
It is a basic app where you can add accounts and details to that accounts. You can also change details in that account and delete them too.
A few exceptions are implemented, as for example, you can't delete an account if it's in arrears or if it still has money in it. 
Need to first lodge or withdraw money from it to be on zero before you can close the account.
When an exception is thrown a pop up message comes up warning you of the issue.
